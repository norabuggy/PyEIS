PyEIS: A Python-Based Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy simulator and analyzer

Author: Kristian B. Knudsen

V. 1.0.10
———————————————
Released February 1, 2019

Bugs:
* Fixed import of experimental data, which was broken due to package issues
* Fixed masking data could lead to nan values in the dataframe that made legends 'nan' strings and gave errors during fitting of linear KK analysis
* Fixed Label settings for Nyquist and Bode plot have been simplified
* Fixed Label settings from the relative residuals between fit and experimental data have been simplified
* Fixed Auto-scaling of the relative residuals between fit and experimental data have been optimized

Features and improvements:
* PyEIS is now compatible with Solartron's '*.z' data format
